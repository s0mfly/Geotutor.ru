# Geotutor

## Описание 
Geotutor is a web application for solving geometric problems, created to help teachers and students

## Why did I decide to do this, and what came of it?

In the 10th grade, I had to do a school project, initially I wanted to create a regular timer and not try to grow further, but I managed to talk with a math teacher and he offered me the idea of creating
an initial version of the site (then it was a simulator for students), soon we got carried away with it, and I managed to win with this project at the International Forum of Scientific Youth "Step into the Future"

## Problem:

Most control and measuring materials and geometry simulators contain such tasks, the solution of which is posted on the Internet

## Relevance:

IT technologies in the modern world are beneficial in many ways. However, when monitoring students' knowledge, there is a problem with copying solutions from the Internet, the solution to which I found is that
using information technology, you can almost infinitely increase the number of variations of tasks, which prevents cheating, both from each other and from the Internet. 
The routine work of a teacher takes a lot of time, and the site's capabilities partially solve this problem by providing a summary of completed tasks by students

## Uniqueness:

Teachers can create "unique" works and not be afraid that students will write from each other or from the Internet, since tasks are generated in algorithms, and not taken from a database

## Advantages over analogues:

1. Quick generation of unique job options
2. The simplicity and accessibility of the site for both students and teachers
3. Convenient output of work options (immediately in the docx file)
4. Solving the tasks assigned by the teacher WITHOUT registering on the website
